My video player, even if set to width: 100%, was only 100% of a tiny parent.\nThe Fix: CSS to the Rescue # The solution involved two key CSS additions:\nWrapping the Video: I modified my youtubeLite.html shortcode to wrap the element in a new div with the class video-embed-wrapper. \u0026lt;!-- layouts/shortcodes/youtubeLite.html --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;video-embed-wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lite-youtube ...\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/lite-youtube\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Targeted CSS: In the custom.css(assets/css/custom.css): /* 1. Style the new video wrapper */ .video-embed-wrapper { width: 100%; max-width: 720px; /* Match lite-youtube\u0026#39;s max-width */ margin: 1.5em auto; /* Center and add space */ } .video-embed-wrapper lite-youtube { width: 100%; display: block; } /* 2. Fix the collapsing ancestor container */ /* This targets the problematic div with max-w-fit (or similar) */ section.flex.flex-col \u0026gt; div.min-w-0.min-h-0 { max-width: none; /* Override shrinking behavior */ width: 100%; /* Ensure it takes parent\u0026#39;s width */ } How it Works: # The new .video-embed-wrapper gives the video a stable container. More importantly, the CSS targeting the section div forces the article\u0026rsquo;s main column to maintain a proper width, even without trailing text. This allows article-content (and thus the video wrapper) to size correctly based on the max-w-prose limit.\nReferences: # paulirish/lite-youtube-embed: A faster youtube embed.\n","date":"2025-05-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/posts/wrestling-the-shrinking-youtube-embed-in-blowfish/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently hit a strange CSS snag on my Hugo site (Blowfish theme) where my youtubeLite embedded videos would \u003cstrong\u003eshrink dramatically\u003c/strong\u003e if I hid the \u0026ldquo;Related Content\u0026rdquo; section below them.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Wrestling the Shrinking YouTube Embed in Hugo \u0026 Blowfish","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2025-05-10","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/tags/youtube-embed/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"YouTube Embed","type":"tags"},{"content":" Addtional Refinement [pending] Custom Domain Activated.

He compares a well-run company to a beautiful theorem. For example, a company that is very efficient and effective in all aspects can be considered beautiful. Surround yourself with the smartest and best people you can find, and let them do their thing. Trust those you hire. You do not need to micromanage them, especially if they are smarter than you. Don\u0026rsquo;t run with the pack. He considers himself to be a good but slow thinker. Instead of competing in areas with lots of competition, it\u0026rsquo;s better to find something original to work on. Don\u0026rsquo;t give up easily. Give your work a chance to succeed. Hope for good luck. Simons emphasizes that this is the most important principle. However, he also believes that luck favors the prepared mind to some extent. He cites Dennis Sullivan as an example: when Sullivan proves a theorem, he is very prepared and would not attribute his success to luck. Simons distinguishes between this type of \u0026ldquo;prepared luck\u0026rdquo; and pure luck. \u0026ldquo;By taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.\u0026rdquo; Comment from the interviewer.\nReferences:\nThe mathematician who cracked Wall Street | Jim Simons - YouTube\nA conversation with Jim Simons: Mathematics, Common Sense and Good Luck - YouTube\n","date":"2025-05-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/posts/jim-simons/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAny one anomaly might be a random thing, however, if you have enough data, you can tell that it\u0026rsquo;s not.\nYou can see an anomaly that\u0026rsquo;s persistent for a sufficiently long time \u0026ndash; the probability of it being random is not high.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Jim Simons","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2025-05-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/tags/mathematics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mathematics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-05-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/tags/quants/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Quants","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025-05-09","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/tags/randomness/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Randomness","type":"tags"},{"content":" 0:00:00 Bill Evans Trio - When I Fall in Love\n0:04:53 Bill Evans Trio - Waltz For Debby\n0:11:44 Bill Evans - Danny Boy\n0:15:27 Bill Evans - I Loves You Porgy\n0:21:28 Bill Evans Trio, Stan Getz - But Beautiful\n0:27:12 Bill Evans - Reflections In D\n0:34:12 Bill Evans - Love Theme From \u0026lsquo;Spartacus\u0026rsquo; ♥️\n0:39:21 Bill Evans Trio - Young And Foolish\n0:45:13 Bill Evans, Bob Brookmeyer - As Time Goes By ♥️\n0:52:08 Bill Evans Trio - Polka Dots And Moonbeams\n0:57:09 Bill Evans, Jim Hall - Romain\n1:02:29 Bill Evans Trio - I Wish I Knew\n1:07:09 Bill Evans Trio - Alice In Wonderland\n1:15:45 Bill Evans - I\u0026rsquo;ll See You Again\n1:19:40 Bill Evans - My Romance\n1:21:38 Bill Evans - Here\u0026rsquo;s That Rainy Day\n1:26:56 Bill Evans - You Must Believe In Spring\n1:32:38 Bill Evans - Re: Person I Knew\n","date":"2025-05-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/kyo-garden/music/bill-evans/","section":"Music","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"video-embed-wrapper\"\u003e\n    \u003clite-youtube videoid=\"w2Zl9hm9VFE\" playlabel=\"w2Zl9hm9VFE\" params=\"\"\u003e\u003c/lite-youtube\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e0:00:00 Bill Evans Trio - When I Fall in Love\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Bill Evans","type":"music"},{"content":"Hi, my name is Kyo, and welcome to my garden!\nThis little corner of the internet, \u0026ldquo;Kyo\u0026rsquo;s Garden,\u0026rdquo; is a space where I cultivate and share things that I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about.
